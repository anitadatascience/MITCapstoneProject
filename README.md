MIT Data Science Capstone Project on Loan Default Prediction based on the domain

Problem Summary
â€”
Retail bank profits rely heavily on the interests they earn from home loans. The loans
are borrowed by regular income/high earning clients. But banks are also fearful for
defaulters as bad loans are a huge loss in profits so banks are judicious while approving
loans for their customer base. The approval loan process is extremely effort-intensive,
multifaceted, and prone to human error/biases.
Our objective is to build a machine that can learn this approval process and make it
more efficient and free of biases. The machine must not learn the same biases that
humans make. We need to build a classification model to predict clients who are likely
to default on their loan and give recommendations to the bank on the important features
to consider while approving a loan.
